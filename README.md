jQrack:

Javascript and JQuery based Two Player Versus Game

A two-player game that pits the jQuery knowledge of one player against the other. The trivia questions cover an assortment of topics from the jQuery library and are designed to test your lightning quick knowledge of jQuery.

Each player is tasked with answering questions within the allotted time and is awarded points for correct answers. But be careful! Each correct answer is worth 10 points, while each wrong answer selected will take 3 points away from your score.

Game play alternates between players with the current player being indicated by a white box around the player title. Each match plays to 50 points and the game is won when a player has won 3 rounds.

Controls:

Just click the correct answer...if you can.

User Stories
As a player, I have the option of playing the game without a partner, so that I can enjoy it solo when there's no-one to play with.

The Needy One: As a player, when I load the url jQrack game, I want to receive instructions to play the game, be able to start a new game, choose a category of questions, and play a game against my friend.

The Lone jQuery Wolf: As a player of the jQrack game, I want to be able to free play through trivia questions of my own selection without having to play against another player so I can test my jQuery knowledge all on my own.

The Overachiever: As an administrator of the jQrack game, I want to be able to easily change the categories of questions, and the questions themselves, used in the jQrack game, making it simple to repurpose the jQrack game to trivia about many different topic items.
